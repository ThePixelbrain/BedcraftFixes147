# BedcraftFixes147

A nilmod that was specifically designed for Bedcraft's Rewind Upsilon Server to fix and patch old 1.4.7 mods.

All patches contain a short description in the config file and can be turned on or off individually.

## Credits

The mod takes huge inspiration from [UpsilonFixes](https://git.sleeping.town/Rewind/UpsilonFixes), aka it copies most
of its internal structure.

All patches contained in this mod are too specific to our use case to warrant a PR to UpsilonFixes.
If a bug or patch affects all of Rewind Upsilon, a PR should rather be made to UpsilonFixes instead.

Massive thanks to Una for creating Nil, which does all the heavy lifting.
Without her work this project wouldn't be possible.
